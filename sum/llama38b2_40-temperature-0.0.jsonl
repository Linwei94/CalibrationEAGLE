The long-term impact of the treatment is not yet known.\n\nCurrently, the NHS pays for patients deemed suitable for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment, which costs an average of \u00a3100,000 per patient. It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017.\n\nThe Cardiff center will also provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and supportive care.

The service has made a 21,500-mile round trip to Australia to hire 225 paramedics on \u00a34,500 'golden hello' payments. This decision was made because it is cheaper to hire paramedics from abroad than to train them in the UK, where it costs \u00a350,000 to train one paramedic.\n\nThe selection process for these paramedics was held at five-star hotels in Australia and consisted of a practical demonstration, a written exam, and an interview that lasted between four and six hours. The process was so quick that applicants received an email informing them of their job status by 8am the next day.\n\nThe article highlights the reasons behind the shortage of paramedics in the UK, including:\n\n1. Growing numbers of paramedics quitting the NHS due to frustration with long queues outside A&E units and non-urgent calls from patients unable to see a GP.\n2. Increasing demand on ambulances, leading to longer response times for seriously ill patients.\n3. Paramedics choosing to take up posts as 'advanced practitioners' in A&E, GP surgeries, and call centres for the 111 helpline, where the work is less stressful and they can earn more.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service has been the hardest hit by this exodus, with 340 posts vacant and over 230 paramedics quitting last year. However, Australia has a surplus of paramedics, making it an attractive option for the UK.\n\nThe article also mentions that other understaffed ambulance services in the UK are considering hiring paramedics from abroad, including Poland.

They highlight the opportunity to work as a paramedic in a new country, the chance to see more of Europe, and the possibility of furthering their careers.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the challenges faced by the NHS in recruiting and retaining paramedics, and the measures being taken to address this shortage, including hiring paramedics from abroad."], "idxs": [93], "new_tokens": [456], "wall_time": [6.856566429138184]}], "tstamp": 1771977637.6151962}

This exposure is typically around 10 \u03bcSv per day.\n\n2. **Cosmic Radiation**: Frequent flyers are exposed to increased radiation from cosmic rays, which can be significant. A 10-hour flight across the North Atlantic can result in a radiation exposure of 50-100 \u03bcSv.\n\n3. **TrackYourDose App**: The app uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists to track personal radiation exposure. It takes into account changes in location, flights, and medical examinations.\n\n4. **Radiation Sources**: The app measures all relevant types of radiation, including neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere. It also accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and from medical examinations.\n\n5. **Radiation Units**: The measurement is recorded in microsieverts (\u03bcSv). In the US, this is often measured in a unit called rem, and one sievert is equivalent to 100 rem.\n\n6. **Comparison of Radiation Exposure**: A 10-hour flight across the North Atlantic results in a radiation exposure of 50-100 \u03bcSv, while an X-ray at a dentist exposes patients to 6 \u03bcSv. A mammogram produces 3,000 \u03bcSv.\n\n7. **Pilot Radiation Exposure**: Airline pilots are at risk of deadly skin cancer due to exposure to cockpit radiation, which is similar to levels from tanning beds. Pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed.\n\n8. **Radiation Limits**: The lowest yearly dose linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100,000 \u03bcSv, while a dosage of 2,000,000 \u03bcSv is considered severe and potentially fatal.\n\n9. **Sources of Natural Radiation**: Approximately half of"], "idxs": [79], "new_tokens": [440], "wall_time": [6.018542289733887]}], "tstamp": 1771977697.8951435}

Sheff also mentioned that they may call Patriots officials, including owner Bob Kraft, to testify if their testimony is relevant.\n\nWard expressed her love for her son and the pain of losing him, saying, \"The day I learned my son was shot and killed, I thought my life ended with his. I always wished I was there to take those bullets for Odin.\" She also stated that her son was loved by many and will be missed tremendously.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, and Sheff plans to file papers to resume the lawsuit in the next few weeks to hunt down Hernandez's assets. One known asset is his home in North Attleborough, which is assessed at $1.2 million.\n\nSheff is not confident that Hernandez has any money left after defending himself in the criminal trial, but he believes Hernandez made millions during his career.

The discovery was made by British firms Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, and Falkland Oil & Gas at the Zebedee exploratory well. The find is estimated to be worth billions of pounds and could yield 100 million barrels of oil.\n\nThis news has heightened tensions between Britain and Argentina, which claims the Falkland Islands as its own territory. Argentina has threatened to prosecute oil companies operating in the area, claiming they are acting \"illegally\" in Argentine territory. The Argentine government has also announced plans to file a joint legal complaint with the foreign and planning ministries to try and block further exploration.\n\nThe discovery comes amid worsening relations between Britain and Argentina, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. Britain has pledged to invest \u00a3180 million over the next ten years to defend the islands, including an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters.\n\nThe oil discovery has sparked concerns about the potential for renewed conflict over the Falkland Islands, with some experts warning that Argentina may try to claim the islands as its own due to the economic benefits of the oil find. However, others have downplayed the risks, pointing out that oil is often found in difficult and disputed areas, such as Alaska.\n\nThe situation has also been complicated by allegations that Britain was spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011, which were revealed by American whistleblower Edward Snowden. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims.\n\nOverall, the oil discovery in the Falkland Islands has heightened tensions between Britain and Argentina, and has sparked concerns about the potential for renewed conflict over the disputed territory."], "idxs": [69], "new_tokens": [368], "wall_time": [5.496482610702515]}], "tstamp": 1771977786.437675}
